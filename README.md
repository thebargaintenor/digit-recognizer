# Digit Recognizer

This is a handful of exercises in using basic ML techniques on the MNIST dataset.  That's... about it.
The format for the data is covered by the files in `/data`.
I'm not going to mention a whole lot more since though these techniques aren't anything special, this _was_ a homework assignment.

If any of you did get here from Wheeler's class somehow... no one is going to put .net on Agate again.  Go away.
It would have taken you less time to write the assignment than finding this. ಠ_ಠ

## Usage

```
dotnet run [nb|linear|knn] < data_file
```

It's not rocket surgery.
